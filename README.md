## üîß Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Updating
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Clear cache in browser settings
- Check service worker update in DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers

### Environment Variables Not Loading
- Ensure `.env.local` is in root directory (not in subdirectories)
- Restart dev server after adding/modifying variables: `npm run dev`
- Check Vercel dashboard for production environment variables
- Verify variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify Supabase URL and service role key in `.env.local`
- Check RLS policies are enabled (run `database-complete-setup.sql`)
- Ensure Supabase project is active (not paused)
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings

### Spotify API Errors
- Verify client ID and secret are correct
- Check API credentials haven't expired
- Ensure you're within Spotify API rate limits
- Test credentials at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)

### Build/Deployment Failures
- Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be 18+)
- Review build logs for specific errors

### Poster Upload Issues
- Ensure `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is set (auto-generated on Vercel)
- Check file size (max 10MB) and type (JPEG, PNG, WebP only)
- Verify Vercel Blob is enabled in project settings
- Check browser console for specific error messages
